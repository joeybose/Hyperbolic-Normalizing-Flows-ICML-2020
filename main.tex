\begin{abstract}
The choice of approximate posterior distributions plays a central role in stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of normalizing flows defined on Euclidean spaces to construct flexible posterior distributions. 
However, practitioners often have prior knowledge of their data in the form of known underlying hierarchies, and existing normalizing flows designed for Euclidean space are unable to utilize this prior knowledge. In this work, we consider the problem of SVI of latent variables in order to learn expressive posteriors that respect the hierarchical structure of given data. We first elevate normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces, which are better equipped for modeling hierarchical structures. We further introduce Wrapped Hyperbolic Coupling, a fully invertible and learnable transformation that explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces allowing for expressive posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate the efficacy of our Wrapped Hyperbolic Coupling flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean normalizing flows. 
Our approach achieves improved performance on density estimation, as well as reconstruction of real-world graph data, which exhibit a hierarchical structure. 
Finally, we show that our approach can be used to power a generative model over hierarchical data using hyperbolic latent variables.

% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
